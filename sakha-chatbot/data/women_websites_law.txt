Ensuring the safety and well-being of women is an imperative in any society. In India, where women have made significant strides in various fields, safety concerns continue to be a pressing issue. Fortunately, numerous organizations and websites are dedicated to empowering women and providing valuable resources to enhance their safety. And don’t hesitate to take legal help when you feel that you or your rights are violated. Reach out for help and report abuse. In this article, we’ll explore the top 10 safety websites in India that every woman should be aware of to navigate the complex landscape of women’s rights and personal safety.


Top 10 Safety Websites Every Indian Woman Should Know
Nirbhaya — Be Fearless, Be Free: Women’s Safety Resources in India
Nirbhaya: Be Fearless, Be Free is a comprehensive resource that aims to equip women with the knowledge and tools to ensure their safety. The website offers information on self-defense techniques, safety tips, and resources for reporting and addressing harassment or violence. It’s a valuable platform for women to gain confidence and assert their rights.

It came into existence after the brutal gang rape and murder of a young woman on December 16, 2012, in Delhi, India. The victim’s name was Jyoti Singh Pandey, but she is often referred to as “Nirbhaya” in the media, which means “fearless” or “courageous” in Hindi.

The Nirbhaya case was a watershed moment in India, sparking widespread outrage and protests across the country. The incident highlighted issues related to women’s safety, gender-based violence, and the need for legal reforms. The public outcry and the demand for justice led to significant changes in Indian law, including stricter punishment for perpetrators of sexual violence.

The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2013 was enacted in response to the tragic Nirbhaya case. This legislation brought about significant changes by amending various Sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Indian Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Code.

Under this amendment, several new offences were introduced into the Indian Penal Code, including acid attacks (Sections 326A and 326B), voyeurism (Section 354C), stalking (Section 354D), attempting to disrobe a woman (Section 354B), sexual harassment (Section 354A), and sexual assault resulting in death or causing a person to be in a persistent vegetative state (Section 376A).

Additionally, the Act made existing offences more stringent. Notably, it expanded the definition of rape in Section 375 to encompass acts beyond penetration. It also replaced Section 370 with Sections 370 and 370A, aligning the definition of trafficking with the UN Trafficking Protocol, although “forced labor” was excluded. For further amendments related to rape and sexual violence crimes, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 2018 should also be referenced.
